    "Leo_Breiman random forestThe history began way back in 1980s. This algorithm was a result of incessant team work by Leo Breiman, Adele Cutler, Ho Tin Kam, Dietterich, Amit and Geman. Each of them played a significant role in early development of random forest. The algorithm for actuating a random forest was developed by Leo Breiman and Adele Cutler. This algorithm is register in their (Leo and Adele) trademark. Amit, Gemen, Ho Tim Kam, independently introduced the idea of random selection of features and using Breiman’s ‘Bagging’ idea constructed this collection of decision trees with controlled variance. Later, Deitterich introduced the idea of random node optimization.

    "Random Forest is a versatile machine learning method capable of performing both regression and classification tasks. It also undertakes dimensional reduction methods, treats missing values, outlier values and other essential steps of data exploration, and does a fairly good job. It is a type of ensemble learning method, where a group of weak models combine to form a powerful model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Random Forest, we grow multiple trees as opposed to a single tree in CART model (see comparison between CART and Random Forest here, part1 and part2). To classify a new object based on attributes, each tree gives a classification and we say the tree “votes” for that class. The forest chooses the classification having the most votes (over all the trees in the forest) and in case of regression, it takes the average of outputs by different trees.\n",
