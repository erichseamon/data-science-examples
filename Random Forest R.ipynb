    "Leo_Breiman random forestThe history began way back in 1980s. This algorithm was a result of incessant team work by Leo Breiman, Adele Cutler, Ho Tin Kam, Dietterich, Amit and Geman. Each of them played a significant role in early development of random forest. The algorithm for actuating a random forest was developed by Leo Breiman and Adele Cutler. This algorithm is register in their (Leo and Adele) trademark. Amit, Gemen, Ho Tim Kam, independently introduced the idea of random selection of features and using Breiman’s ‘Bagging’ idea constructed this collection of decision trees with controlled variance. Later, Deitterich introduced the idea of random node optimization.

    "Random Forest is a versatile machine learning method capable of performing both regression and classification tasks. It also undertakes dimensional reduction methods, treats missing values, outlier values and other essential steps of data exploration, and does a fairly good job. It is a type of ensemble learning method, where a group of weak models combine to form a powerful model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Random Forest, we grow multiple trees as opposed to a single tree in CART model (see comparison between CART and Random Forest here, part1 and part2). To classify a new object based on attributes, each tree gives a classification and we say the tree “votes” for that class. The forest chooses the classification having the most votes (over all the trees in the forest) and in case of regression, it takes the average of outputs by different trees.\n",

    "In Random Forest, each tree is planted & grown as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume number of cases in the training set is N. Then, sample of these N cases is taken at random but with replacement. This sample will be the training set for growing the tree.\n",
    "If there are M input variables, a number m<M is specified such that at each node, m variables are selected at random out of the M. The best split on these m is used to split the node. The value of m is held constant while we grow the forest.\n",
    "Each tree is grown to the largest extent possible and  there is no pruning.\n",

    "Pros:\n",
    "\n",
    "As I mentioned earlier, this algorithm can solve both type of problems i.e. classification and regression and does a decent estimation at both fronts.\n",
    "One of benefits of Random forest which excites me most is, the power of handle large data set with higher dimensionality. It can handle thousands of input variables and identify most significant variables so it is considered as one of the dimensionality reduction methods. Further, the model outputs Importance of variable, which can be a very handy feature. Look at the below image of variable importance from currently Live Hackathon 3.x.\n",
    "Variable_Important\n",
    "It has an effective method for estimating missing data and maintains accuracy when a large proportion of the data are missing.\n",
    "It has methods for balancing errors in datasets where classes are imbalanced.\n",
    "The capabilities of the above can be extended to unlabeled data, leading to unsupervised clustering, data views and outlier detection.\n",
    "Random Forest involves sampling of the input data with replacement called as bootstrap sampling. Here one third of the data is not used for training and can be used to testing. These are called the out of bag samples. Error estimated on these out of bag samples is known as out of bag error. Study of error estimates by Out of bag, gives evidence to show that the out-of-bag estimate is as accurate as using a test set of the same size as the training set. Therefore, using the out-of-bag error estimate removes the need for a set aside test set.\n",
    "Cons:\n",
    "\n",
    "It surely does a good job at classification but not as good as for regression problem as it does not give continuous output. In case of regression, it doesn’t predict beyond the range in the training data, and that they may over-fit data sets that are particularly noisy.\n",
    "Random Forest can feel like a black box approach for statistical modelers – you have very little control on what the model does. You can at best – try different parameters and random seeds!\n",
